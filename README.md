# Advanced NLP Sentiment Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning techniques. It classifies reviews into **Positive** and **Negative** sentiments and provides predictions through a FastAPI REST API.
